<div>Unsolicited advice for BIG presentations</div>
<div>Tom MacWright <a href="https://github.com/tmcw/big">describes Big</a> as "a ridiculous presentation system that works great for creative, hurried people."</div>
<div>If you are not hurried, <strong>maybe don't use Big,</strong> because you will <em>look</em> hurried, possibly to your detriment, as though you <em>gave no thought to good design</em>.</div>
<div>By the way, that was a <strong>TERRIBLE SLIDE</strong>.</div>
<div>Long sentences of GIANT TEXT in <em>lots</em> <a>of</a> <strong>colors</strong> are very difficult to read.</div>
<div data-bodyclass="eyes"></div>
<div>If you want to be verbose, try one of two things:</div>
<div>1. Write little; talk a lot.</div>
<div>Big is pretty nice for a couple of words, or short sentences.</div>
<div>2. Make a normal web page or something.</div>
<div>If your goal is to share your wordiness with the web, <strong>BIG IS TERRIBLE FOR THIS</strong>.</div>
<div><img src="article.jpg"/>The regular ol' web is <strong>GREAT FOR THIS</strong>.</div>
<div>Oh, did you see there was a background image on that last slide?</div>
<div>If you remove<br><code>background-size:100%</code></br>from your styles in order to accommodate your fun repeating gif,</div>
<div data-bodyclass="eyes"><strong>( )</strong></div>
<div>your carefully cropped screenshot backgrounds may look crazy on desktop computers.</div>
<div data-bodyclass="studio">wtf</div>
<div>In conclusion,</div>
<div>Use Big for quick, easy, and <strong>short</strong> slides.</div>
<div>Paragraph-length giant text is the <strong>worst thing in the world.</strong></div>
<div>Look at the <a href="http://www.macwright.org/big/">examples</a> Tom provided. They demonstrate effective uses.</div>
<div>Consider the balance between <a href="https://medium.com/@agafonkin/how-to-give-awesome-public-talks-a2b727f4bc24">designing for speaking vs designing for sharing</a>.</div>
<div><strong>Spend time</strong> on good design if you can.</div>
<div>Your audience deserves it.</div>
